FirePHP-chrome is an extension for Google Chrome to allow the Chrome console to display FirePHP messages.

The primary limitation of this is that the FirePHP server-side implementation (in Zend Framework) looks for a string containing 'FirePHP' in the User-Agent request header. Chrome currently doesn't allow you to change this and so I've patched Zend Framework to also respond to the 'X-Wf-User-Agent' header. This patch is in zend/wildfire-user-agent.patch.

TODO:
----

- support all logging types (currently supports WARN, LOG, INFO, ERROR)
- fill in manifest file for extension properly
- package up as chrome crx file
- autoupdating
- submit Zend patch
